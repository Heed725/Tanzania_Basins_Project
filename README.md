## 🌍 About the Map

This map illustrates the major river basins across Tanzania, showing how hydrology is influenced by the country’s terrain, climate, and geological history.

### Major river basins included:

* 💧 **Lake Victoria Basin** – Drains into Africa’s largest lake, supporting dense populations and agriculture in the north.
* 🏞️ **Lake Tanganyika Basin** – Flows into one of the world’s deepest lakes, rich in biodiversity and fisheries.
* 🌾 **Rufiji Basin** – The largest basin in Tanzania, vital for irrigation, hydropower, and wetlands.
* 🌊 **Pangani & Wami–Ruvu Basins** – Supply fresh water to Dar es Salaam, Tanga, and other coastal cities.
* 🌍 **Ruvuma Basin** – A transboundary system forming part of the Mozambique border, crucial for cooperation in water management.
* 🏔️ **Lake Rukwa Basin** – A closed inland basin with seasonal water level changes influencing local ecosystems.
* 🐟 **Lake Nyasa Basin** – Shared with Malawi and Mozambique, sustaining fishing communities and unique biodiversity.
* 🏝️ **Pemba Basin** – Drains Pemba Island’s catchments into the Indian Ocean.
* 🏝️ **Unguja Basin** – Zanzibar’s main island drainage, important for agriculture and freshwater supply.
* ⛰️ **Internal Basins** – Small, isolated catchments in Arusha, Manyara, Dodoma, and Singida, often ending in wetlands or seasonal pans.
